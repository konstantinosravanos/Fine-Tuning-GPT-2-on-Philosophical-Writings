📖 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the GPT-2 language model on a curated dataset of philosophical quotations. The goal is to train a model that can generate text in the style of famous philosophers, capturing their tone, reasoning style, and choice of words.

📂 Repository Contents
Fine Tuning- GPT2.ipynb — Main Jupyter Notebook performing:

Data loading from multiple .txt files.

Tokenization using Hugging Face Transformers.

Model fine-tuning on the philosophical corpus.

Checkpoint saving for later use.

Text generation to produce sample philosophical outputs.

Text Dataset — Each .txt file contains quotes or excerpts from a single philosopher:

Aristotle.txt — Works and sayings of Aristotle.

Artemiou.txt — Modern philosophical reflections.

Freud.txt — Ideas from Sigmund Freud.

Kant.txt — Writings of Immanuel Kant.

Sartre.txt — Works of Jean-Paul Sartre.

Schopenhauer.txt — Works of Arthur Schopenhauer.

📜 Dataset Description
The dataset is composed of plain-text documents, each dedicated to one author. They include direct translations, summaries, and original philosophical notes. This combination allows the fine-tuned model to learn diverse patterns of reasoning and writing, enabling generation that mimics various philosophical styles.

⚙️ How the Code Works
The notebook follows a structured workflow:

Load & Merge Data
Reads each .txt file individually or merges them into one training corpus.

Tokenize Text
Uses Hugging Face’s tokenizer to split the text into model-readable tokens.

Fine-Tune GPT-2
Trains a pre-trained GPT-2 model on the dataset, adjusting parameters for best performance.

Save Trained Model
Stores both the model weights and tokenizer for reuse without retraining.

Generate Text
Produces original, philosopher-style outputs based on prompts you provide.

🎯 Purpose
Demonstrate fine-tuning of GPT-2 with custom text data.

Explore style imitation of notable philosophers.

Provide a reusable codebase for language model customization.

⚠️ Notes
Texts are included for research/educational purposes; check licensing before public use.

The model’s outputs are synthetic and may contain inaccuracies.
